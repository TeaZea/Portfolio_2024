Decided to use sqlite3 to organize project.
Decided not to build a model for experiences since it's going to use styles from the previous iteration of the portfolio site, and will link directly to LinkedIn.



Things I liked:
Workign with Django was a lot of fun, mainly becuase I really enjoy Python.
Once I got the hang of how to leverage the admin portion of Django, I really started thinking about other ways I can improve my databases.

Things I found Challenging:
I had to restart this revamp a couple of times because I had trouble with organizing my templates and static files.
Obviously, the views and urls was confusing at first, but once I got the hang of it, I really saw the power of frameworks.
My understanding and practical use of jinja can always be better.



Dev Notes:
CTRL + F5 to refresh page when CSS is not updating.
